# Simon Says Game â€“ Classic Memory Game (Clone)
This is a clone of the classic "Simon Says" game, built using  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any external libraries or frameworks.
This project i built during learning DOM events in JavaScript .

## What the Game Does
- Generates a random sequence of color flashes and sounds.

- User must repeat the exact sequence by clicking colored buttons.

- With each level, the sequence increases by one.

- A wrong move resets the game.

## How to Play
-Start the game by pressing any key.

-Watch the color and sound sequence.

-Repeat the same sequence by clicking the buttons.

-With every correct level, the sequence grows.

-A wrong click gives a game over sound + restart prompt.

## What I Learned
 * DOM manipulation with JavaScript
 * Event listeners and game state management
 * Using timeouts and delays for animations
* Implementing game logic: sequences, user input, matching
* Creating a fully responsive layout
* Error handling and UX improvements
